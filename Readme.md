## Decisions

**Custom Segment Controller** 

I have decided to use  _CollectionView_ because it gives a developer a lot of variety option to edit as requirment. Moreover, If a client asks to add around 10 options in your segment controller where segment controller has to be scrollable, here _Collection view_ is very handy to customise.

**Custom Image Loader**

I have used _SDWebImage_ a third party library using _cocoapods_. It loads image quickly as it caches the image and there are many other features like keeping placeholder image and so on.

Please [visit the website](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SDWebImage) for more information on this library.

**Skelton view for loading**
I have used skelton view a third party library for showing the loading state of the application. Please [Vist Website](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SkeletonView) for more information.

**Data Fetching**

I have used _Decodable protocol_ to fetch data from server as it is the latest, fast and trending way of fetching
 

## If I had More time

- I would have written more testcases for different functionality in the code. 
- I would have given a try to desgn the UI with swift UI

## Improvements/ Suggestions

- Search functionality can be provided based on date or location as it will be easy for the users to look for a particular event.
- The white text for venue, location, time and date are not very clearly readable when on some images. I wou;d sugest if we give a slight dark background it would be better
